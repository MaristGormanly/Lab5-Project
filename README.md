# Final Project 

# Introduction 
The goal behind this final project was to create a fully functional website to further our knowledge in web development. This was the first ever website I ever made, and I did it in my Software Dev 2 class. This project helped understand the main elements of how most social media websites function with the help and guidance of Professor Gormanly. The final part of it we created a list of users that you can choose from and this is where they can post as that specific user.

To create this website we used html, css, and client and server side javascript, and a database using postgres.

4. Go back once more into your console and type out: npm start

5. The server will be running at that point this where you'll see the message saying "Listening on port1337!"

# How to use the site

npm install
Visit localhost:1337 in your browser

We created a database to keep track of the posts and the messenges. 

# Current Features 
1. Allows a user to pick a user to sign in and create certain posts

2. Highly advanced homepage 

3. Event feed API

4. Responsive webpage


# Problems I ran into 
Learning the material and then implenting it was the tricky part. I'm more of a hands on learner and need the guidence of peers and Professor to truly learn what I'm doing.
